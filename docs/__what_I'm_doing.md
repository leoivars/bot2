# what I'm doing

Here I put information for 'Leo of the future' in such a way that I remember what I am doing and continue with this task.


# dec 4 2022

Yesterday I finally decided to start with bot2 and have translated the first script bot_laucher.py (lanzador.py in bot).
I'm also working on organizing the documentation and thinking of a new package structure.

Leo: You need to start documenting bot_main.md and start rewriting bot_main.py

bot_main.py firt line #from mercado import Mercado
Leo: You need to translate Mercado.py

market.py (ex mercado.py) fist line #from vela import Vela
Leo: You need to translate vela.py
