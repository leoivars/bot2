# Overall Explanation

I am trying to learn Python and the best way to learn is through experience. Today I already know the language but I know that I still have a long way to go to master it. At the same time I try to catch up with current development techniques.

I decided to develop a [bot](https://github.com/leoivars/bot) that buys and sells on the Binance spot market to meet my goals. I started with a simple script that grew (and continues to mutate) into something more sophisticated. Bot works despite not being finished but I don't like its code. This project tries to translate it to a better quality version and with some changes regarding the main idea.

I would like this repository to evaluate my evolution as a programmer over time.

Everything you like about this repository is yours. All your suggestions are of help.
Thanks.

If by those chances of life you become a millionaire using this code, it wouldn't be bad to donate a couple of million to me :-)

# bot2 

Bot2 is based on everything learned in [bot](https://github.com/leoivars/bot) but with these fundamental changes: 

1) everything must be documented 

2) everything must be in English 

3) the buyer thread will always run on an enabled simbol and the main thread will launch seller threads for each buy that will terminate once the sale is made.
