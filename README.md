# Overall Explanation

I am trying to learn Python and the best way to learn is through experience. Today I already know the language but I know that I still have a long way to go to master it. At the same time I try to catch up with current development techniques.

I decided to develop a bot that buys and sells on the Binance spot market to meet my goals. I started with a simple script that grew (and continues to mutate) into something more sophisticated.
Currently a main thread creates secondary threads that are in charge of obtaining the ohlcv data, processing it to make trading decisions applying a strategy (in constant development).
Each buy is closed with a sale and this information is stored in a mysql database.

I am currently working on modifying the strategy, doing backtesting and refactoring the ugly  code  to improve its quality. The more I learn, the better I code.

I would like this repository to evaluate my evolution as a programmer over time.

The work in general was made in spanish, in the future I will translate it into English.

Everything you like about this repository is yours. All your suggestions are of help.
Thanks.

# bot2 

Bot2 is based on everything learned in bot but with these fundamental changes: 

1) everything must be documented 

2) everything must be in English 

3) the buyer thread will always run on an enabled simbol and the main thread will launch seller threads for each buy that will terminate once the sale is made.
